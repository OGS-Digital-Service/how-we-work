How NYS Digital Service Works - Discussions &amp; Open Work

## Work in the Open
Because we work for the people, our code is almost entirely public domain and open. There are prudent reasons to keep some work private (Ex. codebases with environment variables, private keys, hashes, workflows internal to support), but almost anything we build that is visible on a public website to the public, has public source code. 

## Simple solutions first
Forget frameworks and co-pilot. If we can't solve it with static, semantic-first HTML, CSS, or simple JS - then consider moving outwards into abstractions and helpers. Code we write should be readable and understandable by most developers. The simpler the solution the more sustainable, resilient, and often - cheaper, it is.
